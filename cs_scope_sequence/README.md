# CS Scope


> The purpose of this *README* is to discuss the scope and high level process behind WDI CS Curriculum.


## Process

* **Weekly**: Each week students are given a pre-written list of problems to complete by the end of that week. Monday, at the beginning of each week problems and the **theme** of the week will be discussed. CS vocabulary will also be built up in each week of the course. At the end of each week students will use vocabulary to play **catch-phrase**.
* **Daily**: Each day students begin by reviewing the solution for one of the problems in the weekly problem set.

## Scope

### Week 1

* **Theme**: what is an algorithm? Linear and constant runtimes.
* **SWBAT**: 
  * dicuss how to break down simple problems into expressions and control flow.
  * discuss the basic ideas of data types and introductory data structures
  * identify common expressions and control flow strategies.
  * implement basic control flow exercises
* **Concepts**:
  * conditionals, loops, iterators, etc
  * variable swapping
  * in-place techniques: indexes and values
  * destructive methods
  * side effects: reference types vs values
  * array bases stacks and queues: shifting and popping
  * efficiency: using arrays vs objects, accessing and manipulating data types
  * NOT BIG O ... yet (growth mindset).

### Week 2

* **Theme**: intro to runtimes and programming paradigms: linear and polynomial runtimes
* **SWBAT**: 
  * Discuss recursion: terminal and recursive conditions
  * Compare and contrast looping vs recursion
  * Discuss and implement iterative methods: `each`, `map`, etc.
  * Disucss stack overflow issues
  * Apply problem solving and pseudo coding techniques
* **Concepts**:
  * recursion
  * functional control flow
  * object and object relationships/references
  * loops vs nested loops
  * iterators methods: `map`, `each`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### Week 3

* **Theme**: searching algorithms and divide and conquer solutions: intro to log(n) runtimes
* **SWBAT**: 
  * Discuss and apply searching through each item in an array
  * Discuss and apply searching through nested arrays or objects
  * Discuss and apply binary search strategies
* **Concepts**:
  * intro to depth first search
  * recursion
  * divide and conquer
  * logarithmic runtime
  * linear runtime review
  * polynomial time review


### Week 4

* **Theme**: sorting algorithms and nlog(n) runtimes
* **SWBAT**:
  * Discuss and apply pseudo coding approaches to synthesize simple sorting strategies
  * Discuss and implemment bubble sort
  * Discuss and implement sorted array merging strategies 
  * Discuss and implement mergeSort using recursion and the concept of `merge` function.
* **Concepts**:
  * recursion
  * divide and conquer
  * bubble sort
  * merge sort


### Week 5

* **Theme**: Questions on PM
