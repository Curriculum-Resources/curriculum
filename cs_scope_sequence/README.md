# CS Scope


> The purpose of this *README* is to discuss the scope and high level process behind WDI CS Curriculum.


## Process

* **Weekly**: Each week students are given a pre-written list of problems to complete by the end of that week. These problems will be introduced and the **theme** of that week discussed at on the monday of each week. Review and build vocabulary for each week using catchphrase cards.
* **Daily**: Each day students begin by reviewing the solution for one of the problems in the weekly problem set.

## Scope

### Week 1

* **Theme**: what is an algorithm? Linear and constant runtimes.
* **SWBAT**: 
  * dicuss how to break down simple problems into expressions and control flow.
  * discuss the basic ideas of data types and introductory data structures
  * identify common expressions and control flow strategies.
  * implement basic control flow exercises
* **Concepts**:
  * conditionals, loops, iterators, etc
  * variable swapping
  * in-place techniques: indexes and values
  * destructive techniques
  * side effects: reference types vs values
  * array bases stacks and queues: shifting and popping
  * efficiency: using arrays vs objects, accessing and manipulating data types
  * NOT BIG O ... yet (growth mindset).

### Week 2

* **Theme**: intro to runtimes and programming paradigms: linear and polynomial runtimes

* **SWBAT**: 
  * Discsuss recursion
  * "" functional control flow
  * "" linked lists/object relationships


### Week 3

* **Theme**: searching algorithms and divide and conquer solutions: intro to log(n) runtimes 


### Week 4

* **Theme**: sorting algorithms and nlog(n) runtimes

### Week 5

* **Theme**: Questions on PM

### Week 6

* **Theme**: Re-implement major problems in ruby, linked list intro


### Week 7
