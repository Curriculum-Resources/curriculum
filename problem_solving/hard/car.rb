# Design a class called Car with the properties speed and color, and methods
# accelerate(), decelerate(), and changeColor(). Decide for yourself if these
# should be class or instance methods. The color needs to be set when a car
# is instantiated; the speed defaults to 0. A car can go a maximum of 200mph.
# Acceleration and deceleration should happen in steps of 20mph by default,
# but can be adjusted when passing in an integer to these methods.
