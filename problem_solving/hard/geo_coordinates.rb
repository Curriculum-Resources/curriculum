# Write a method that takes an array of geographic coordinates and returns
# clusters of coordinates, the size of which can be adjusted by zoom (precision)
# level. Use the geocluster gem (github.com/dchacke/geocluster). The idea here
# is to learn how to read documentations of unknown gems/plugins that you could
# use in your own project so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
