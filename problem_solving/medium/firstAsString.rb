# Write a method that monkey-patches arrays to have a firstAsString() method,
# which returns the first element of any array as a string, no matter what
# that array is. For example, [1, 2, 3].firstAsString should return '1'.
# Also, [{ foo: :bar }, 2, 3].firstAsString should return '{ foo: :bar }'.
